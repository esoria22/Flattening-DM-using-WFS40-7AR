Configuration file and serial number
====================================

All mirror from ALPAO are referenced by a unique serial name,
you can find it on the back of the mirror, for example: "BAL001".

You will find, in that folder, two configuration files (where BXXYYY is the serial number):
 - BXXYYY.acfg which is an ASCII files describing the interface.
 - BXXYYY which is a binary file.

See "Manual/Alpao Mirror SDK v3 - Programmers Guide.pdf" chapter 6 for more informations.
